  1. Securing the connection between the client (phone / tablet / etc)
with the server. This should be done through the SSL setup. (How about VPN when available)?


For Discussion:
We can do the Louis way, installing custom rom so we can modify the android itselff (disabling some
function of the phone).
Pros: - We can take full control of the phone, meaning we can decide what goes into the phone (disable the camera, disable playing music, etc)
Cons: - We're running rooted phone. If the user are elaborate
enough, they can install their own rom which is very easy to do
nowadays.


Examples to look at:
We could adopt similar functionality like in these apps:
Lock stuff down:
https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.carrotapp.protectpronew

Do stuff based on location:
https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.twofortyfouram.locale

Do stuff:
https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=net.dinglisch.android.taskerm

You can combine these to lock apps (or even encrypt a file) based on location...
